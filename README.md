# Port2.1
This portfolio takes the layout of the original 2.0 and deploys it to a heroku server, allowing express routing and the use of nodemailer for my contact form. Checkout the deployed portfolio here: https://ancient-sands-70959.herokuapp.com/

## Description
While I was happy with the layout of Port2.0 (https://github.com/LucasAho/Port2.0), I had yet to implement a proper email form and update elements. I took this update as an opportunity to learn Nodemailer, adding an express server that could be run on Heroku and a MVC framework to organize my code. I also drew the thumbnails for the recent showcase elements, and removed some outdated projects. This express server will be especially helpful if I add the highscore tracker across my deployed games, which is my only remaining plan for improvment (at the moment).

## Plan for Improvement
* Highscore section that tracks scores on all portfolio games

## File Infrastructure

### Public/Views
